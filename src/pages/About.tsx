      <p>RewriteLikeMe helps people use AI to write without sacrificing the individuality and beauty of their style.</p>
      <p>Of course creating a Voice for their style specifically is a bit expensive, which is why you can only create new Voices on the web app. However! You can still try Voices on other people's styles for free in this app. And we may very well make it so that you can download and use voices you create into this app.</p>
